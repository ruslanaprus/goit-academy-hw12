/**
 * Provides classes to execute the FizzBuzz problem in a multi-threaded environment.
 * <p>
 * The FizzBuzz problem involves outputting a sequence of numbers from 1 to n with specific replacements:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "fizz".</li>
 *     <li>Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "buzz".</li>
 *     <li>Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced with "fizzbuzz".</li>
 * </ul>
 * This package contains the following classes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link org.example.fizzbuzz.FizzBuzzManager} - Manages the tasks for generating FizzBuzz outputs.</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.example.fizzbuzz.FizzBuzzExecutor} - Executes the FizzBuzzManager in a multi-threaded environment and collects the results.</li>
 * </ul>
